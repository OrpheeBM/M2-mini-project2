winter but listen   i met this new girl late june or early july i called her a bunch of times but she barely replied now its december im driving and shes like wheres my hi its weird that i never called you cause i rarely get shy see that was a segue i believe the matter is what happens after the season where the leaves just scatter where the timb laces get tighter and parka hoods flip up drug dealers standing in their park or hood slip up where girls become exes from summers caught hoin the winter cars come out the summer cars go in and some places is breezy and some it start snowin and if you planning family vacations you better know when but some mothers scared to send they daughters out the city instead she get a sweater that she bought her out of pity cause mom stays up late she seen them videos where cancun college students pouring water on their titties   yeah man its a funny thing going through the winter up here man a lot of girls yknow wanna get close you might think they the one but just wait nah mean take it slow   forget to mention this girl that never gets to the beach she lives just west of my street and so we destined to meet since im driving i ask her how to get to the suite she doesnt answer opens the door and just gets in the seat she throws her bag in the back and starts adjusting the heat shes bold but i roll with it im impressed cause shes sweet then she says i heard your song and im obsessed with the beat i mean the lyrics are good but im obsessed with the beat i love it when voyce sings and the chorus is good theres a couple things in the song that i suggest you repeat off this im kinda taken back for a second i get her number she tells me to call her after this session and so i do and its kind of awkward the surface hard to scratch until we end up sexin and now my heart attached im thinkin off i shouldve been more southern and realizing all that she wanted was that indoor lovin and ho   yeah uh i told yall i had a story for you right uh ya man its what it is   and now im proud to have her like montreal to the frizzench she love to play hurt like carter did on the bizzench but my boy say im actin different because i lay downtown and i still i rush to pick her up from work and fizzench she tellin everyone imma hold here down tell everyone im the prince up in this cold clear town and stupid me i just listen to her instead of wondering if this is really gon last me the whole year round but then spring shows up and its dallas in this bitch the weather starts to resemble the holidays she missed when we were together it seeming like way back when ball players hop on the plane and make it way back in see she used to play piana and now she never wait for santa instead of saving for marriage she saving for caribana and its a shame she had me convinced that she couldve been a dime i guess i lost another one to the wintertime   i miss you most of all my darling  give me a second to gather my thoughts  strolling in the park ho and watching winter turn to spring such a beautiful day man yeah man you know we had to switch it on em right strolling in the park and watching winter turn to spriing im still standing on two feet even after this tragic loss man but i got something to else to tell ya baby   i remember them encore pms breakfast and the wake up now drakes committed we waiting on the breakup so we can get back to them cognac nights with dress codes and light skinned girls that wont act right and i laugh cause my previous lifestyle was quite wild the winter came and blew his cold air through back then light sweaters and a couple drinks might get her by the end of the week i would know that crew and wed assembled a trio a whole new scene with three ladies in the shot we never broke routine at the end of every cut when the cameras are rollin we had ladies hearts always gettin damaged and stolen but this summer is different its a two man operation granted the fact that we one man short got love for him he can watch this new man stop a nation cause handlin crack is a one man sport instead of dressup i walk in sweat pants and charms clinkin i find a girl we step dance and calm drinkin the face the breast the bras the toes im still solo and a long night draws to a close cause its a fact if she come to the crib and i get some ass inside well never talk again scary and true that song special i recorded with voyce well its like a classified its what im lookin for to carry me through yet i cant seem to find it every girl that possesses it only wants a friendship causing me to forget the shit and when they talk about they past and lovers and you get mad at the thought of it giving ass to others yet you find peace with yourself now least theres some room to
